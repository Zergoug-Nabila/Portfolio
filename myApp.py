            I am a recent graduate with a Bachelor's degree in Information Systems and Software Engineering, where I developed a financial tracking system for construction projects, and a Master's degree in Intelligent Information Systems Engineering, where I created a system for monitoring and predicting blood glucose levels in children.

            Currently, I am enrolled in a Data Scientist Bootcamp to further enhance my skills.

            In April 2024, I started working as a Database Manager, and I learn a lot every day in the professional world.

            On my YouTube channel, I am creating tutorials for people who:
            - are looking for a way to leverage the power of Python in their day-to-day work.
            - are struggling with repetitive tasks in Excel and are looking for a way to use Python and VBA.
            - want to learn Data Analysis & Data Science to perform meaningful and impactful analyses.
            - are working with Excel and found themselves thinking - "there has to be a better way."
